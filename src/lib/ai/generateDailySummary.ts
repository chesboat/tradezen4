## ðŸ“Š Inputs

**Trades:**
A list of trades in this format:
- symbol
- direction (long/short)
- risk amount
- RR ratio
- result (win/loss/breakeven)
- linked mood or note if any

**Quick Notes:**
A list of any quick notes they wrote that day.  
Each note includes:
- note text
- tags (like "FOMO", "discipline", "mistake")
- mood emoji if present
- timestamp

**Daily Stats:**
- Total P&L for the day
- Win rate
- Total XP earned
- Mood trend for the day (e.g., neutral â†’ excellent)

---

## ðŸŽ¯ Output

âœ… Write 3-5 short paragraphs.  
âœ… Highlight:
- What went well today (focus on trade execution and rule-following)
- What didn't go well (mistakes, rule breaks, mindset slip-ups)
- Recurring patterns you notice from the notes/tags
- A single clear lesson or focus for tomorrow

âœ… Use a friendly, coaching tone.  
âœ… Be specific but short.  
âœ… Avoid generic fluff â€” always tie comments to their real data.

## ðŸ“Œ Example Output

"Nice work today! You executed 4 trades with a solid win rate of 75% and ended with a profit of $165. Your mood improved from neutral to excellent, showing good emotional control.

From your notes, I see you tagged 'discipline' and 'stick to plan' multiple times, which is a good sign you're building consistency. One note mentioned a manual lockout after a strong session â€” great discipline!

You did well not to revenge trade after a loss. Keep an eye on overtrading tomorrow, since you took more trades than your daily plan.

Focus tomorrow: stick to your risk levels, review setups before entering, and close the day early if you feel your edge is gone."
