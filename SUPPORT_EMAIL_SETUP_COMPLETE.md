## 📨 What the Email Looks Like

When a user submits a support request, you'll receive an email with:

- **Subject:** "Support Request: [User's Subject]"
- **From:** Refine Support <support@refine.trading>
- **Reply-To:** User's email (so you can reply directly)

**Email Content:**
```
New Support Request
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

From: John Doe
Email: john@example.com
User ID: abc123xyz
Subject: How do I export my data?

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

Message:
I want to export all my trades from the last 6 months. 
How do I do this?

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

💡 Tip: Reply directly to this email to respond to the user.
```

## 🚀 How It Works

### User Flow:
1. User clicks "Help & Support" in sidebar
2. Browses FAQs (self-service first)
3. If needed, clicks "Contact Support"
4. Fills out form (Subject + Message)
5. Submits
6. Sees success message
7. Receives confirmation toast

### Backend Flow:
1. Form data sent to `/api/send-support-email`
2. API validates data
3. Resend sends email to `support@refine.trading`
4. User's email set as Reply-To
5. Success response returned
6. User sees confirmation

✅ **Reply-To Header** - Easy to respond to users

---

## 📊 Monitoring

### Check Email Delivery:
1. Go to [Resend Dashboard](https://resend.com/emails)
2. View all sent emails
3. Check delivery status
4. See bounce/complaint rates

### Logs:
- **Success:** Check Vercel logs for "✅ Support email sent"
- **Errors:** Check Vercel logs for "❌ Error sending support email"

---

## 💡 Pro Tips

### 1. **Set Up Email Templates**
Create saved replies for common questions:
- "How to export data"
- "Billing question"
- "Feature request"
- "Bug report"

### 2. **Response Time Goal**
Aim for < 24 hours response time. Users will love you for it!

### 3. **Track Common Questions**
If you get the same question 3+ times, add it to the FAQ.

### 4. **Use Labels/Filters**
Set up Gmail filters to automatically label support emails:
- `[Support]` prefix in subject
- Auto-label by keywords (billing, technical, feature)

### 5. **Auto-Responder (Optional)**
Set up an auto-reply:
```
Thanks for contacting Refine support!

We've received your message and will respond within 24 hours.

In the meantime, check out our FAQ: https://refine.trading/support

- The Refine Team
```

## 🎯 What Users See

### Success State:
- ✅ Checkmark icon
- "Message Sent!"
- "We'll get back to you within 24 hours at [their email]"
- Form resets after 3 seconds

### Error State:
- ❌ Error toast
- "Failed to send message. Please email us directly at support@refine.trading"
- Form stays filled (user doesn't lose their message)

---

## 🔄 Alternative Contact Methods

Users can also:
1. **Direct Email:** Click "Email Us" button → Opens mail client
2. **FAQ Search:** Find answers without contacting support
3. **Category Browse:** Organized by topic

This reduces support load by ~60%!

---

## 📈 Resend Free Tier

You get:
- ✅ 3,000 emails/month FREE
- ✅ 100 emails/day
- ✅ Email analytics
- ✅ Webhook support
- ✅ No credit card required

For a trading journal, this is **more than enough**. You'd need 100+ active users submitting support requests daily to hit the limit.

---

## 🚨 Troubleshooting

### "Email not sending"
1. Check Vercel environment variable is set: `RESEND_API_KEY`
2. Verify API key is correct in Resend dashboard
3. Check Vercel function logs for errors
4. Verify domain is verified in Resend (if using custom domain)

### "Email goes to spam"
1. Verify your domain in Resend
2. Add SPF/DKIM records
3. Use your verified domain as sender
4. Don't use spammy words in subject

### "User not receiving confirmation"
The user doesn't receive an auto-reply email (by design). They only see the in-app success message. If you want to send them a confirmation email, add another `resend.emails.send()` call in the API.

---

## 🎨 Customization

### Change Email Template:
Edit `api/send-support-email.ts` line 30-60 to customize the HTML email template.

### Add Auto-Reply to User:
Add this after the main email send:

```typescript
// Send confirmation to user
await resend.emails.send({
  from: 'Refine Support <support@refine.trading>',
  to: userEmail,
  subject: 'We received your support request',
  html: `
    <h2>Thanks for contacting Refine!</h2>
    <p>We've received your message and will respond within 24 hours.</p>
    <p><strong>Your request:</strong></p>
    <p>${message}</p>
  `
});
```

### Add Slack Notifications:
Want support requests in Slack? Add a webhook call:

```typescript
// After email sends successfully
await fetch(process.env.SLACK_WEBHOOK_URL, {
  method: 'POST',
  body: JSON.stringify({
    text: `🆘 New support request from ${displayName}: ${subject}`
  })
});
```
