# üçé Stripe Customer Portal Setup Guide

## What is the Customer Portal?

The Stripe Customer Portal is a **secure, hosted page** where your users can:
- ‚úÖ Update payment methods (credit cards)
- ‚úÖ View billing history & invoices
- ‚úÖ Upgrade/downgrade subscriptions
- ‚úÖ Cancel subscriptions
- ‚úÖ Download receipts

**Apple uses this same feature** for managing subscriptions on the web. It's trusted, secure, and PCI-compliant.

## Test Mode vs Live Mode

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Important: You Have TWO Separate Portals

Stripe has **two completely separate environments**:

| Mode | Purpose | Configuration |
|------|---------|---------------|
| **Test Mode** üß™ | Development & testing | Configure separately |
| **Live Mode** üöÄ | Real customers & money | Configure separately |

**Right now you're in TEST MODE** (sandbox). This is the correct place to be during development!

### How to Tell Which Mode You're In:

1. Look at the **top-left** of Stripe Dashboard
2. You'll see a toggle: **"Test mode"** or **"Live mode"**
3. **Orange banner** = Test mode ‚úÖ (safe!)
4. **No banner** = Live mode ‚ö†Ô∏è (real money!)

---

## Step-by-Step Setup (Test Mode)

### Step 1: Access Customer Portal Settings

1. **Go to:** https://dashboard.stripe.com/test/settings/billing/portal
2. **Ensure** you see "Test mode" toggle is ON (orange)

### Step 2: Activate the Portal

Click the blue **"Activate link"** or **"Activate Customer Portal"** button.

### Step 3: Configure Settings (Apple Way)

#### **Business Information**
- ‚úÖ Add your business name: `Refine` or `TradZen`
- ‚úÖ Add support email (yours for testing)
- ‚úÖ Privacy policy URL (optional for test mode)
- ‚úÖ Terms of service URL (optional for test mode)

#### **Functionality** (Enable these for best UX)

**Customer Information:**
- ‚úÖ Allow customers to update email address

**Payment Methods:**
- ‚úÖ Allow customers to update their payment methods
- ‚úÖ Allow customers to delete payment methods (if they have multiple)

**Subscriptions:**
- ‚úÖ Allow customers to switch plans (upgrade/downgrade)
- ‚úÖ Allow customers to cancel subscriptions
  - **Cancellation behavior:** 
    - Select: **"Cancel at period end"** ‚úÖ (Apple's way - they paid for it, they keep it)
    - OR: **"Cancel immediately"** (if you prefer instant cancellation)

- ‚úÖ Allow customers to view their invoice history

### Step 4: Save Configuration

Click **"Save changes"** at the bottom.

## Testing the Portal

### Test Users You Can Use:

‚ö†Ô∏è Decline: 4000 0000 0000 0002
‚è∞ Requires authentication: 4000 0025 0000 3155
```

**Expiry:** Any future date (e.g., `12/34`)  
**CVC:** Any 3 digits (e.g., `123`)  
**ZIP:** Any 5 digits (e.g., `90210`)

### Test Flow:

1. **Sign up** for an account in your app
2. **Choose a plan** (Basic or Premium)
3. **Use test card:** `4242 4242 4242 4242`
4. **Complete checkout** ‚Üí You'll get redirected back
5. **Go to Settings** ‚Üí You should now see **"Manage Subscription"**
6. **Click it** ‚Üí Stripe Customer Portal opens

## Before Going Live

When you're ready to accept **real payments**, you'll need to:

### Step 1: Switch to Live Mode
1. Toggle **"Test mode"** to OFF in Stripe Dashboard
2. You're now in **Live Mode** (real money!)

### Step 2: Configure Live Mode Portal
Repeat the exact same setup at:
```
https://dashboard.stripe.com/settings/billing/portal
```
(Note: No `/test/` in the URL)

### Step 3: Update Your App's Environment Variables
- Replace test API keys with live API keys
- Update in Vercel environment variables
- Redeploy

### Step 4: Verify Everything Works
- Test with a **real card** (yours)
- Cancel immediately to avoid charges
- Check webhooks are firing

---

## Troubleshooting

### Error: "No configuration provided"
**Cause:** Portal not activated  
**Fix:** Follow Step 2 above (Activate the Portal)

### Error: "Customer does not have a subscription"
**Cause:** User hasn't completed checkout yet  
**Fix:** This is now prevented by our UI (button hidden if no `stripeCustomerId`)

### Portal Opens But Shows Error
**Cause:** Stripe keys mismatch (test vs live)  
**Fix:** Ensure both frontend and backend use same mode (test or live)

### Webhooks Not Firing
**Cause:** Webhook endpoint not configured  
**Fix:** Check `STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET` is set in Vercel
