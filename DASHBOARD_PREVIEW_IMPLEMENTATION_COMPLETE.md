  totalPnL: 24450.75,
  winRate: 68,
  avgRR: 1.8,
  tradeCount: 142,
  equityCurve: [...] // 13 data points
}

// Calendar
DEMO_CALENDAR: {
  currentStreak: 12,
  bestStreak: 28,
  completionRate: 82,
  days: [...] // Full October 2025
}

```

### Easy to Update
Want to change the demo data? Just edit `demoData.ts` - all frames update automatically!

## 🚀 HOW TO USE

### Development
```bash
npm run dev
```

Navigate to homepage and scroll to hero section. The animation will start automatically when it comes into view.

### Testing
- **Hover** over the preview to pause
- **Click dots** at the bottom to navigate manually
- **Scroll away** and back to see intersection observer in action

### Customization

**Change animation speed:**
```typescript
// In DashboardHeroPreview.tsx
const frames = [
  { id: 'health-rings', duration: 3000, ... }, // Change from 2500 to 3000
  // ...
];
```

**Change frame order:**
```typescript
// Reorder the frames array
const frames = [
  { id: 'ai-insights', ... }, // Show AI first!
  { id: 'health-rings', ... },
  // ...
];
```

**Update demo data:**
```typescript
// In src/lib/demoData.ts
export const DEMO_ANALYTICS = {
  totalPnL: 50000, // Change from 24450.75
  winRate: 75,     // Change from 68
  // ...
};
```

## 🎓 LESSONS LEARNED

### What Worked Well
1. **Real components** - Much better than screenshots
2. **Demo data centralization** - Easy to update
3. **Framer Motion** - Smooth animations out of the box
4. **Intersection Observer** - Great for performance
5. **Progressive disclosure** - One concept per frame

### What We'd Do Differently
1. Consider adding manual controls earlier (arrows, keyboard)
2. Add analytics tracking from day 1
3. Build A/B testing framework upfront
4. Add `prefers-reduced-motion` from start

### Key Takeaways
- **Apple's approach works**: Real components > screenshots
- **Performance matters**: Intersection observer is essential
- **User control matters**: Hover to pause is critical
- **Demo data matters**: Aspirational but realistic numbers
- **Iteration matters**: Build MVP, then optimize based on data

## 📞 SUPPORT

### Common Issues

**Issue**: Animation doesn't start  
**Solution**: Check intersection observer threshold (currently 0.3)

**Issue**: Animation is too fast/slow  
**Solution**: Adjust `duration` in frames array

**Issue**: Theme transition is jarring  
**Solution**: Adjust transition duration in `DashboardHeroPreview.tsx`

**Issue**: Components don't match design  
**Solution**: Update demo data in `src/lib/demoData.ts`

### Need Help?
- Check browser console for errors
- Verify all imports are correct
- Ensure Framer Motion is installed
- Test in different browsers

## 🏆 SUCCESS METRICS

### Quantitative KPIs (Track These!)
- **Trial Signup Rate**: Target 3-5% (baseline: 1.5%)
- **Time on Page**: Target 45+ seconds (baseline: 20s)
- **Scroll Depth**: Target 70%+ (baseline: 45%)
- **Animation Completion**: Target 60%+ watch full loop
- **Bounce Rate**: Target < 40% (baseline: 55%)

### Qualitative Feedback (Ask Users!)
- "What made you sign up?" (mention animation?)
- "What almost stopped you?" (animation too fast/slow?)
- "What did you like most?" (which frame?)
- "What confused you?" (any unclear messaging?)
