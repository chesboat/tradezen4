# Potential R - Quick Start Guide

## What Is It?

A system to track whether your profit targets are **too conservative**. By recording how far price actually ran past your target, we can analyze patterns and suggest better targets that could increase your average win size.

## The Concept

You're targeting **0.75R** on most trades, but they actually run to **1.0R** or more on average?

That means you're **leaving money on the table**. The analytics will tell you:
- How much further price typically runs
- What target would capture more
- How much more profit you'd make per trade

## How to Use (3 Simple Steps)

### Step 1: Log "Potential R" on Winning Trades

After a trade wins and closes:

1. Go to **Trades** page
2. Find the trade in the list
3. Click the **⋮ (three dots)** menu on the right
4. Select **"Add Potential R"** (only shows for wins)
5. Enter the **actual R value** price reached
   - Example: If your target was 0.75R but price ran to 1.2R, enter `1.2`
6. Click **Save**

That's it! One click per trade.

### Step 2: Build Up Data

Log potential R for several trades (aim for 5-10 per target size):
- When you target 0.75R, log what it actually reached
- When you target 1.0R, log what it actually reached
- Patterns emerge as you collect more data

### Step 3: Check the Analytics

1. Go to **Analytics** dashboard
2. Scroll down to find **"Potential R Analysis"** card
3. See the AI insight at the top
4. Review your target performance
5. Check the scenario modeling

## What You'll See in Analytics

### The AI Insight

A smart recommendation like:

> 💡 "Your 0.75R targets typically run to 1.2R. Consider targeting 0.97R instead for +33% more per win."

Or:

> 💡 "Your targets are well-calibrated. Price runs 0.78R on average vs. 0.75R target."

### Target Performance Breakdown

Shows each target size with stats:

```
0.75R target (22 wins tracked)
├─ Price actually ran to: 1.2R on average
└─ Gap: +0.45R (45% higher than target!)

1.0R target (15 wins tracked)
├─ Price actually ran to: 1.5R on average
└─ Gap: +0.5R
```

### Scenario Modeling

Real numbers showing what could happen:

```
Current approach (0.75R target)
├─ Avg win: $200 per trade

↓ (If you targeted 0.95R instead)

New approach
├─ Avg win: $267 per trade
└─ Improvement: +$67 (+34%)
```

All based on YOUR actual trading history!

## Real Example

**Let's say you have these 5 winning trades:**

| Trade # | Target R | Price Actually Ran To | Win Amount |
|---------|----------|----------------------|-----------|
| 1       | 0.75R    | 1.15R               | $230      |
| 2       | 0.75R    | 1.10R               | $220      |
| 3       | 0.75R    | 1.18R               | $240      |
| 4       | 1.0R     | 1.50R               | $300      |
| 5       | 1.0R     | 1.45R               | $290      |

**Analytics show:**

For 0.75R trades (trades 1-3):
- Average ran to: 1.14R
- Gap: +0.39R (39% higher)
- Insight: "Consider targeting 0.95R instead"

For 1.0R trades (trades 4-5):
- Average ran to: 1.47R
- Gap: +0.47R (47% higher)
- Insight: "Consider targeting 1.24R instead"

## Why This Matters

### Example Impact

You trade 10 times per week. Currently targeting 0.75R with avg win of $200.

Currently: **10 trades × $200 = $2,000/week**

If you followed the suggestion and targeted 0.95R instead (and price still runs the same):

New: **10 trades × ($200 × 1.27) = 10 × $254 = $2,540/week**

**That's +$540/week (+27%)**

Over a year: **$28,080 extra** from just better target sizing!

## The Smart Part

This isn't guesswork. The analysis is based on:
- ✅ YOUR actual trades
- ✅ YOUR specific targets
- ✅ YOUR market conditions
- ✅ YOUR execution quality

So the recommendations are tailored exactly to how you trade.

## Tips for Best Results

1. **Be honest about the numbers**
   - Enter what price actually reached, not what you hoped
   - Use the high (for longs) or low (for shorts)

2. **Log consistently**
   - Even if you forget sometimes, that's OK
   - The more trades you log, the better the analysis

3. **Check monthly**
   - Patterns might change seasonally
   - Market conditions evolve
   - Adjust accordingly

4. **Don't change everything at once**
   - Test the suggestion on a few trades first
   - See if your win rate stays the same
   - Then decide to commit

5. **Consider the context**
   - If one day was an outlier (very volatile), maybe skip it
   - If market conditions changed, data might be outdated
   - Use it as a guide, not gospel

## FAQ

**Q: Do I need to log it for every trade?**
A: No, it's optional. But the more you log, the better the analysis. Aim for at least 5 per target size.

**Q: What if I already have trades without potential R?**
A: No problem! You can edit them anytime by clicking the menu again.

**Q: What if my targets vary wildly?**
A: The analytics groups by target size, so each size gets its own analysis. Use what makes sense for you.

**Q: Should I immediately change my targets?**
A: Not necessarily. Wait for 10+ trades at each target before committing. One lucky day isn't a pattern.

**Q: Does this guarantee better results?**
A: No. It shows what *could* happen based on historical patterns. Future markets might behave differently. Use it as guidance.

## Next Level: Refining Your Strategy

Once you've seen the patterns:

1. **Test incrementally**
   - Use the suggested target on 5-10 trades
   - Monitor if win rate stays the same
   - Track if price still runs as far

2. **Adjust by market**
   - You might use different targets for different symbols
   - Range-bound markets behave differently than trending
   - Emotional states affect execution

3. **Revisit quarterly**
   - Market conditions change
   - Your skill improves
   - Patterns might shift
