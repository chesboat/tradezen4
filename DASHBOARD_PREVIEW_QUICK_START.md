# Dashboard Preview - Quick Start Guide
## Get Your Apple-Quality Preview Running in 5 Minutes

---

## üöÄ STEP 1: Start the Dev Server

```bash
npm run dev
```

---

## üåê STEP 2: View the Homepage

Navigate to: `http://localhost:5173` (or whatever port Vite uses)

Scroll down to the hero section - you should see the animated dashboard preview!

---

## ‚úÖ STEP 3: Test the Features

### Auto-Play Animation
- The animation should start automatically when you scroll it into view
- It cycles through 5 frames: Health Rings ‚Üí Analytics ‚Üí Theme Transition ‚Üí Calendar ‚Üí AI Insights
- Total loop time: 11.5 seconds

### Hover to Pause
- Hover your mouse over the preview
- You should see "Paused" appear in the top-right corner
- The animation stops
- Move your mouse away to resume

### Manual Navigation
- Click the dots at the bottom to jump to any frame
- 5 dots = 5 frames
- Active dot is larger and colored

### Intersection Observer
- Scroll away from the preview (so it's off-screen)
- Scroll back - animation should resume from where it left off
- This saves CPU when preview isn't visible

---

## üé® STEP 4: Customize (Optional)

### Change Animation Speed

Edit `src/components/marketing/DashboardHeroPreview.tsx`:

```typescript
const frames = [
  { id: 'health-rings', duration: 3000, ... }, // Change from 2500 to 3000ms
  { id: 'analytics', duration: 3000, ... },
  // ...
];
```

### Change Demo Data

Edit `src/lib/demoData.ts`:

```typescript
export const DEMO_ANALYTICS = {
  totalPnL: 50000,  // Change from 24450.75
  winRate: 75,      // Change from 68
  // ...
};
```

Save the file - changes appear immediately (hot reload)!

### Change Frame Order

Want AI insights first? Reorder the frames array:

```typescript
const frames = [
  { id: 'ai-insights', duration: 2500, theme: 'dark', component: AIInsightsFrame },
  { id: 'health-rings', duration: 2500, theme: 'light', component: HealthRingsFrame },
  // ...
];
```

## üêõ TROUBLESHOOTING

### Animation Doesn't Start
**Problem**: Preview is visible but not animating  
**Solution**: Check browser console for errors. Verify Framer Motion is installed:
```bash
npm install framer-motion
```

### Animation is Choppy
**Problem**: Low FPS, stuttering  
**Solution**: 
1. Close other browser tabs
2. Check CPU usage (should be < 20%)
3. Try in Chrome (best performance)

### Components Look Wrong
**Problem**: Styling is off, colors are wrong  
**Solution**: 
1. Check if Tailwind CSS is working (other components should look normal)
2. Verify dark mode is configured in `tailwind.config.js`
3. Clear browser cache and reload

### Import Errors
**Problem**: "Cannot find module" errors  
**Solution**: 
1. Check all files were created correctly
2. Verify file paths match exactly
3. Restart dev server (`Ctrl+C`, then `npm run dev`)
