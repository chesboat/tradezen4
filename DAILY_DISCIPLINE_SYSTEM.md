# Daily Discipline System

## üéØ Overview

We've implemented a **dual-ring system** that separates daily habits from long-term performance tracking, following Apple's design philosophy.

---

## üî• Two Systems Working Together

### **1. Daily Discipline Rings** (Apple Watch Style)
**Purpose:** Simple, binary, achievable daily habits  
**Location:** Dashboard (top widget)  
**Visual Style:** Thin rings (4-6px), bright colors, small footprint (80px)  
**Update Frequency:** Real-time

#### **3 Rings:**

| Ring | Color | Goal | Description |
|------|-------|------|-------------|
| **Journal** üìù | Green | Write reflection today | Captures lessons, insights, market observations |
| **Rules** üéØ | Red | Follow 80%+ of 8 rules | Stop loss, position sizing, no revenge trading, etc. |
| **Discipline** ‚öñÔ∏è | Blue | No critical violations | Risk management, stop losses, emotional control intact |

**Success Metric:** Close all 3 rings ‚Üí Build your streak üî•

---

### **2. Trading Health Rings** (Apple Watch App Style)
**Purpose:** 30-day performance tracker (7d for basic tier)  
**Location:** Dedicated Trading Health view  
**Visual Style:** Thick rings (12-16px), financial colors, large (200px)  
**Update Frequency:** Rolling 30-day average

#### **3 Rings:**

| Ring | Color | Score Range | Description |
|------|-------|-------------|-------------|
| **Edge** üí∞ | Orange/Red | 0-80 | Profit potential per trade (expectancy + profit factor) |
| **Consistency** üéØ | Green/Lime | 0-80 | Following your process (8 automatic rule checks) |
| **Risk Control** ‚ö†Ô∏è | Cyan/Blue | 0-80 | Protecting capital (drawdown, losing streaks, position sizing) |

**Success Metric:** Watch these improve as you follow your daily discipline

## üöÄ Activity Log Integration

When a Daily Discipline ring closes, it automatically logs to the Activity Log:

```typescript
// Example log entries
üìù Journal Ring Closed
   "Completed your daily reflection. Keep the streak going!"
   Priority: medium, XP: +10

üéØ Rules Ring Closed
   "Followed 80%+ of your trading rules today. Consistency is key."
   Priority: medium, XP: +10

‚öñÔ∏è Discipline Ring Closed
   "No critical rule violations today. Discipline maintained."
   Priority: medium, XP: +10
```

**All rings closed?** ‚Üí Special notification: "üéâ All rings closed today!"
