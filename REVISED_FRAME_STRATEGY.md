## ðŸ”§ IMPLEMENTATION APPROACH

### Option A: Full App Screenshots (Quick)
- Take 5 high-quality screenshots of actual app
- Show complete interface (sidebar + main + activity + todo)
- Pros: Fast (1 hour), authentic
- Cons: Need to update when UI changes

### Option B: Simplified Component Mockups (Recommended)
- Build simplified versions showing layout
- Use demo data
- Show sidebar, main content, activity bar, todo drawer
- Pros: Easier to maintain, faster than full recreation
- Cons: More work than screenshots

### Option C: Full Component Recreation
- Recreate entire app layout with all components
- Most authentic but most work
- Pros: Perfect accuracy, no screenshots
- Cons: 2-3 days of work

---

## ðŸ’¡ RECOMMENDATION

**Use Option A (Screenshots) for MVP**, then upgrade to Option B later:

1. **This Week**: Take 5 screenshots showing full interface
2. **Next Week**: Build simplified layout components
3. **Later**: Replace with full component recreation

This gets you shipping fast while maintaining quality!

## ðŸ“¸ SCREENSHOT REQUIREMENTS

For each frame, capture:
- **Resolution**: 1920x1080 (16:9)
- **Format**: PNG (high quality)
- **Content**: Full interface (sidebar + main + activity + todo)
- **Theme**: Frames 1-2 light, Frame 3 transition, Frames 4-5 dark
- **Demo Data**: Use realistic winning trader data

Let me know and I'll implement immediately!
