git commit -m "Fix: Add explicit text colors to auth form inputs

ISSUE: Input fields showed white text in light mode
CAUSE: Inputs inherited text color but didn't have explicit color set
FIX: Added text-gray-900 dark:text-white to all inputs

UPDATED:
- SignupForm.tsx: Email, Password, Confirm Password inputs
- LoginForm.tsx: Email, Password inputs

Now inputs show black text in light mode, white in dark mode."
