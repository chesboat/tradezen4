### 4. Auth Flow

```

2. Click "Start Free Trial"
3. Signup page (with "Back to home" button)
4. Enter payment info (Stripe - not yet integrated)
5. 7-day trial starts
6. Auto-redirect to dashboard
7. Trial banner shows countdown
8. After 7 days → Basic plan ($19/mo)
```

#### **Auth Components**
- ✅ `AuthPage.tsx` - Supports `initialMode` (login/signup)
- ✅ `onBack` prop to return to marketing site
- ✅ Inline login/signup toggle
- ✅ Auto-redirect after auth

---

### 5. Messaging Changes

#### **Trial Commitment Strategy**
**BEFORE:**
- ❌ "No credit card required" (low commitment)

**AFTER:**
- ✅ "7-Day Free Trial • Cancel Anytime"
- ✅ "Cancel anytime, no questions asked"
- ✅ "Cancel anytime • 30-day money-back guarantee"
- ✅ FAQ: "Enter your payment info...won't be charged until day 8"

**Rationale:**
- Trading products need skin in the game
- CC required = higher intent, better engagement
- Industry standard (Tradezella, Edgewonk)
- Emphasizes ease of cancellation over lack of commitment

## 🚀 What's Next - Implementation Roadmap

### **Phase 1: Stripe Integration** (Priority 1)

#### **1. Set up Stripe Account**
- [ ] Create Stripe account (or use existing)
- [ ] Get API keys (test + production)
- [ ] Add keys to environment variables

#### **2. Create Stripe Products**
```
Trial:
- No Stripe product (just local timer)

Basic Plan:
- Price ID: Monthly ($19)
- Price ID: Annual ($168)

Premium Plan:
- Price ID: Monthly ($39)
- Price ID: Annual ($348)
```

#### **3. Implement Stripe Checkout**
**File: `src/lib/stripe.ts`**
```typescript
// Create checkout session
export async function createCheckoutSession(
  priceId: string,
  userId: string,
  email: string
) {
  // Return Stripe checkout URL
}
```

**Update: `src/components/marketing/PricingPage.tsx`**
- Replace `onGetStarted()` with Stripe checkout redirect
- Pass tier (basic/premium) and billing period (monthly/annual)

**Update: `src/components/UpgradeModal.tsx`**
- Replace placeholder with Stripe checkout

#### **4. Implement Stripe Webhooks**
**File: `api/stripe-webhook.ts` (Vercel function)**
```typescript
// Handle events:
// - checkout.session.completed
// - customer.subscription.created
// - customer.subscription.updated
// - customer.subscription.deleted
// - invoice.payment_succeeded
// - invoice.payment_failed
```

**Actions:**
- Update Firestore: `subscriptionTier`, `subscriptionStatus`, `subscriptionExpiresAt`
- Send confirmation emails
- Handle trial → paid conversion
- Handle payment failures

#### **5. Customer Portal**
**File: `src/components/SettingsPage.tsx`**
- Replace "TODO" comment with Stripe portal redirect
- Allow users to update payment method, cancel, view invoices

---

### **Phase 2: Trial Logic Refinement** (Priority 2)

#### **1. Set Trial Start Date**
**File: `src/contexts/AuthContext.tsx`**
```typescript
// On signup, set:
profile.trialStartedAt = new Date();
```

#### **2. Trial Expiration Logic**
**File: `src/hooks/useSubscription.ts`**
```typescript
// Check if trial expired
const trialInfo = getTrialInfo(profile?.trialStartedAt);
if (trialInfo && trialInfo.daysRemaining <= 0) {
  // Show upgrade modal
  // Disable premium features
}
```

#### **3. Auto-Convert Trial → Basic**
**Option A: Webhook (when Stripe charges)**
- User enters CC on signup
- Stripe auto-charges after 7 days
- Webhook updates tier to 'basic'

**Option B: Scheduled Function**
- Cloud function runs daily
- Checks expired trials
- Updates tier in Firestore

---

### **Phase 3: Feature Gates** (Priority 3)

  const used = await getMonthlyAIUsage(userId);
  if (used >= plan.limits.aiMonthlyRequests) {

    return;
  }
}
```

---

### **Phase 4: Email Automation** (Priority 4)

## 🎯 Pricing Optimization (Future)

### **Competitor Benchmarks**

| Edgewonk | - | $79/mo | - |

**Positioning:** 30-50% cheaper than competitors while offering more features (Notes, Todos, AI Coach).

## 🔐 Admin Email Testing

```typescript
// src/hooks/useSubscription.ts
const ADMIN_EMAILS = [
  'your-email@example.com', // Replace with your actual email

## 📝 Notes

### **Why We Chose These Tiers**
- **Trial:** 7 days (industry standard, long enough to build habit)
- **Basic $19/mo:** Affordable for retail traders, covers costs + margin
- **Premium $39/mo:** 2x Basic, positions as "serious trader" tier
- **No free tier:** Trading products need commitment, data shows free users churn fast

### **Why Credit Card Required**
- Higher quality signups
- Better trial → paid conversion
- Seamless billing transition
- Industry standard
- Traders expect to pay for quality tools

### **Pricing is Easy to Change**
All pricing lives in `src/types/subscription.ts`. Update once, changes everywhere:
- Marketing pages
- Pricing page
- Upgrade modal
- Settings page
- FAQs

---

## 🚢 Ready to Ship

The marketing site and subscription framework are **production-ready**. The only missing piece is Stripe integration, which can be added in ~2-3 hours of focused work.

**Next immediate steps:**
1. Update `ADMIN_EMAILS` for testing
2. Deploy and test the marketing flow
3. Set up Stripe account
4. Implement checkout (copy/paste from Stripe docs)
5. Set up webhook endpoint
6. Go live! 🚀
