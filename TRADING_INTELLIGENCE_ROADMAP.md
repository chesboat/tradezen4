## 🎨 Design Philosophy (Apple-Style)

### Core Principles
1. **Simplicity First** - One thing at a time
2. **Show, Don't Tell** - Visual over textual
3. **Personal** - "You" language, feels like a coach
4. **Actionable** - Always suggest next step
5. **Invisible Intelligence** - Never say "AI detected..."
6. **Delightful** - Celebrate progress, gentle warnings
7. **Respectful** - User control, easy to dismiss
8. **Integrated** - Connects trades → habits → reflections → improvement

### Visual Design
- Clean cards with generous whitespace
- Subtle shadows and gradients
- Icon per insight type
- Color coding (green = good, yellow = warning, red = danger)
- Smooth animations (Framer Motion)
- Frosted glass effects
- Apple SF Pro typography

### UX Patterns
- ❌ Don't overwhelm with data
- ✅ One perfect insight > 10 mediocre ones
- ❌ Don't expose technical details
- ✅ Use simple, human language
- ❌ Don't show "AI analyzing..."
- ✅ Just show the insight magically
- ❌ Don't make everything customizable
- ✅ Curate the experience
