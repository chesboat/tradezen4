# Security Fix Report - OpenAI API Key Leak

## Issue Summary
On October 3, 2025, OpenAI detected and disabled an exposed API key (`sk-proj-...cQA`) that was leaked through the public deployment of TradZen4.

## Root Cause
The OpenAI API key was being used client-side with `dangerouslyAllowBrowser: true`, which meant:
1. The API key was embedded in the bundled JavaScript files during build
2. These bundled files were deployed to Vercel and publicly accessible
3. Anyone viewing the website source could extract the API key
4. OpenAI's security scanners detected the exposed key

## Solution Implemented

### 1. **Moved OpenAI API Calls to Secure Backend**
Created serverless API endpoints to handle all OpenAI requests:
- `/api/generate-ai-summary.ts` - Daily journal summary generation
- `/api/generate-ai-quests.ts` - Quest suggestions
- `/api/generate-ai-insight-template.ts` - Reflection templates
- `/api/generate-ai-coach-response.ts` - AI coach interactions
- `/api/parse-trade-image.ts` - Trade image OCR parsing

### 2. **Updated Client-Side Code**
Removed all direct OpenAI client instantiation from:
- `src/lib/ai/generateDailySummary.ts`
- `src/lib/ai/generateQuestSuggestions.ts`
- `src/lib/ai/generateInsightTemplate.ts`
- `src/lib/ai/coachService.ts`
- `src/components/TradeImageImport.tsx`

All these now make secure `fetch()` calls to backend endpoints.

### 3. **Environment Variable Changes**
- **OLD (INSECURE)**: `VITE_OPENAI_API_KEY` - exposed to browser
- **NEW (SECURE)**: `OPENAI_API_KEY` - only accessible to serverless functions

### 4. **Removed Dangerous Pattern**
Eliminated all instances of:
```typescript
const openai = new OpenAI({ 
  apiKey: apiKey, 
  dangerouslyAllowBrowser: true  // ❌ REMOVED
});
```

## Security Benefits
✅ API key never exposed to browser  
✅ API key not embedded in bundled JavaScript  
✅ Reduced attack surface  
✅ Centralized rate limiting and monitoring possible  
✅ Can implement request authentication if needed  

## Next Steps

### Immediate Actions Required:
1. ✅ **Generate new OpenAI API key** at https://platform.openai.com/api-keys
2. ⚠️ **Update Vercel environment variables**:
   - Go to Vercel project settings
   - Remove `VITE_OPENAI_API_KEY` (if present)
   - Add `OPENAI_API_KEY` with new key value
3. ⚠️ **Redeploy the application** with the updated code
4. ⚠️ **Clear the dist folder** before deploying

### Verification:
After deployment, verify:
- [ ] AI features still work (summary, quests, coach)
- [ ] No API key visible in browser dev tools → Network tab
- [ ] No API key in deployed JavaScript bundles
- [ ] Check browser console for any API errors

### Preventive Measures:
- Never use `VITE_` prefix for secrets
- Never use `dangerouslyAllowBrowser: true`
- Keep `dist/` in `.gitignore` (already done)
- Regular security audits of bundled code
- Set up OpenAI API usage alerts and limits

## Files Changed
- `api/generate-ai-summary.ts` (NEW)
- `api/generate-ai-quests.ts` (NEW)
- `api/generate-ai-insight-template.ts` (NEW)
- `api/generate-ai-coach-response.ts` (NEW)
- `api/parse-trade-image.ts` (NEW)
- `src/lib/ai/generateDailySummary.ts` (MODIFIED)
- `src/lib/ai/generateQuestSuggestions.ts` (MODIFIED)
- `src/lib/ai/generateInsightTemplate.ts` (MODIFIED)
- `src/lib/ai/coachService.ts` (MODIFIED)
- `src/components/TradeImageImport.tsx` (MODIFIED)
- `.env.example` (NEW)

## Date Fixed
October 3, 2025

## Notes
The old API key has been disabled by OpenAI and cannot be reactivated. This is actually a good thing as it forces a clean break from the insecure pattern.
