## Recommended Tier Structure (Updated for Refine)

### ❌ **No Free Tier**

## Key Differentiators vs. Tradezella

### ✅ What We Do Better:
1. **AI Coach** - Tradezella doesn't have conversational AI coaching
2. **Habit Tracking** - Deep habit system with streaks, categories
3. **Reflection Focus** - Templates, weekly reviews, daily prompts
4. **Cheaper** - 30% less expensive
5. **Accent Colors** - Personalization they don't offer
6. **Psychology-First** - Focus on mental game, not just stats

### 🤔 What They Do Better (That We Don't Have):
1. **Backtesting** - We don't have this (yet)
2. **Session Replay** - We don't have this (yet)
3. **Mentor System** - They have mentor sharing/invites

### 🎯 Our Unique Value Prop:
**"Tradezella tracks your trades. Refine transforms your trading psychology."**

## Implementation Notes

### Admin Access (For Testing)
Replace `'your-email@example.com'` in `src/hooks/useSubscription.ts` with your email to get instant Premium access for testing.

```typescript
const ADMIN_EMAILS = [
  'your-actual-email@gmail.com',
];
```

### Using Subscription Checks in Components

```typescript
import { useSubscription } from '@/hooks/useSubscription';

function MyFeature() {
  const { hasAccess, checkLimit, tier, plan } = useSubscription();
  
  // Check feature access
  if (!hasAccess('aiInsights')) {
    return <UpgradePrompt message="Upgrade to Basic for AI Insights" />;
  }
  
  // Check limits
  if (checkLimit('maxTrades', currentCount)) {
    return <LimitReached feature="trades" />;
  }
  
  return <MyActualFeature />;
}
```

### When to Show Upgrade Prompts

1. **Approaching Limits**: "You've used 90/100 trades. Upgrade to Basic for unlimited trades!"
2. **Feature Locked**: Try to use AI Coach → "Upgrade to Premium for AI Coach"
3. **Better Experience**: "Unlock all accent colors with Basic"
4. **Soft Upsells**: In Settings, show locked features with "Premium" badge

---

## Future Considerations

### Potential Premium+ Tier ($79/mo)
If we add major features like backtesting, session replay, or team collaboration:
- Unlimited everything from Premium
- Backtesting engine
- Session replay
- Team/firm accounts (multi-user)
- White-label options
- Dedicated account manager

### Lifetime Deal (One-Time)
- $999 one-time for lifetime Premium
- Great for launch/early adopters
- Creates cashflow for development

---

## Next Steps

1. ✅ Subscription tier framework created
2. ✅ `useSubscription` hook implemented
3. ⏳ Create pricing page component
4. ⏳ Add upgrade prompts/CTAs throughout app
5. ⏳ Implement Stripe integration
6. ⏳ Add billing portal (manage subscription, update card)
7. ⏳ Add usage tracking (AI requests, storage, etc.)
8. ⏳ Create upgrade flow (modal with pricing table)
9. ⏳ Add "Upgrade" badges to locked features
10. ⏳ Implement trial period (7-day free trial of Premium?)

---

## Files Modified

- `src/types/subscription.ts` - Tier definitions, limits, helper functions
- `src/hooks/useSubscription.ts` - Subscription state management
- `src/store/useUserProfileStore.ts` - Added subscriptionTier to UserProfile
- `src/components/SettingsPage.tsx` - Using useSubscription hook for accent colors

---

## Questions to Answer

1. **Should we offer a 7-day free trial of Premium?** (Industry standard)
2. **Annual vs Monthly discount?** (Currently 26% off annual - should we go higher?)
3. **Do we want a "Lifetime Deal" for early adopters?** ($499-999 one-time)
4. **Should Free tier have AI at all?** (Maybe 5 AI requests/month to get them hooked?)
5. **Education content behind paywall?** (Video courses, masterclasses for Premium?)
6. **Referral program?** (Give free month for each referral to Basic/Premium?)
