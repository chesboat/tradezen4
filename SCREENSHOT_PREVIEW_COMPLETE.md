## 🔧 CUSTOMIZATION

### Change Animation Speed
Edit `DashboardHeroPreview.tsx`:
```typescript
const frames = [
  { id: 'dashboard', duration: 4000, ... }, // Change from 3000 to 4000ms
  // ...
];
```

### Change Frame Order
Reorder the frames array:
```typescript
const frames = [
  { id: 'analytics', ... }, // Show analytics first!
  { id: 'dashboard', ... },
  // ...
];
```

### Replace Screenshots
Just drop new images in `/public/images/preview/` with same filenames!

---

## 🐛 TROUBLESHOOTING

### Images Don't Load
**Problem**: Screenshots not showing  
**Solution**: 
1. Verify files are in `/public/images/preview/`
2. Check filenames match exactly (case-sensitive)
3. Clear browser cache and reload

### Animation is Choppy
**Problem**: Low FPS  
**Solution**:
1. Optimize screenshot file sizes (use WebP or compressed PNG)
2. Close other browser tabs
3. Try in Chrome (best performance)

### Wrong Aspect Ratio
**Problem**: Screenshots look stretched  
**Solution**: 
- Current code uses `object-cover object-top` which handles varying heights
- If needed, adjust in `DashboardHeroPreview.tsx` line 96

## 🎨 IMAGE OPTIMIZATION (Optional)

If you want to optimize the screenshots for faster loading:

### Option 1: Compress PNGs
```bash
# Using ImageOptim (Mac) or TinyPNG (web)
# Reduces file size by 50-70% with no visible quality loss
```

### Option 2: Convert to WebP
```bash
# Using cwebp (install via Homebrew)
cwebp -q 85 dashboard-light.png -o dashboard-light.webp

# Then update filenames in DashboardHeroPreview.tsx
```

**Current approach is fine for MVP!** Optimize later if needed.
