2. **Intentional Motion** - Every animation has purpose (not decorative)
3. **Material Honesty** - Real UI, not mockups or screenshots
4. **Breathing Room** - Clean spacing, not cluttered [[memory:6378961]]
5. **Emotional Journey** - Curiosity â†’ Recognition â†’ Delight â†’ Understanding â†’ Desire

## User Experience

1. See animated rings closing (unique "Trading Health" concept)
2. Understand depth of analytics (P&L, charts, metrics)
3. Experience smooth theme transition (quality signal)
4. See calendar/streak system (habit formation)
5. Get teased with AI insights (premium features)
6. Can hover to pause and explore each frame
7. Progress dots show position in sequence

## Business Impact

## Next Steps

### Immediate (Pre-Launch)

3. âœ… No linter errors
4. Test in browser (run `npm run dev`)
5. Verify animations are smooth
6. Test on mobile devices
7. Check performance (Lighthouse score)

### Post-Launch Optimization

## Accessibility Notes

**Current Implementation:**
- Hover to pause (keyboard and mouse accessible)
- Progress indicators visible
- High color contrast in both themes
- Smooth animations (not jarring)

**Future Enhancement:**
- Add `prefers-reduced-motion` media query support
- Provide screen reader descriptions for each frame

- ARIA labels for progress indicators

## Browser Compatibility

- âœ… Chrome/Edge (Chromium)
- âœ… Safari (WebKit)
- âœ… Firefox
- âœ… Mobile Safari
- âœ… Mobile Chrome

Uses standard CSS/JS features (Framer Motion handles cross-browser animations).

## Questions for Apple Team Review

1. **Animation Speed**: Is 2.5s per frame the right pace? (Currently feels deliberate)
2. **Theme Transition**: Keep the 1s transition frame or go directly to dark mode?
3. **Frame Order**: Should AI insights come earlier to hook premium interest?
4. **Mobile**: Should we show fewer frames on mobile for faster loop?
5. **Sound**: Would subtle sound effects enhance or distract?
