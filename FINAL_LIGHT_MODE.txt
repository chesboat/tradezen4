THE COMPLETE APPLE SOLUTION:
‚úÖ Added useEffect in App.tsx to force light theme when !currentUser
‚úÖ Updated marketing HomePage background gradients
‚úÖ Updated marketing FeaturesPage background gradients  
‚úÖ Updated marketing PricingPage background gradients

HOW IT WORKS:
- Logged OUT: Force light mode (marketing site = Apple Store)
- Logged IN: Respect user theme preference (app = user choice)
- Signup flow: Force light mode (conversion = trust)

RESULT:
- Homepage is now light mode
- All marketing pages are light mode
- Conversion flow (signup/pricing) is light mode
- Dashboard respects user preference

This is exactly how Apple does it. üçé"
